# Random Brush ![Random Brush Icon](images/RandomBrushIcon.png)

This Brush places random Tiles onto a Tilemap by selecting from defined **Tile Sets** while painting onto the the Tilemap. Use this as an example to create custom Brushes which store specific data per Brush, and to make Brushes with randomized painting behavior.

## Properties

| Property                | Function                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| __Pick Random Tiles__   | Enable this property to pick the Tiles from the current selection as a random Tile Set. |
| __Add To Random Tiles__ | Enable this property to add the picked Tile Sets to existing Tile Sets instead of replacing them. |
| __Tile Set Size__       | Set the size of the Tile Set that is painted by this Brush.  |
| __Number of Tiles__     | The number of Tile Sets.                                     |
| __Tile Set__            | The Tile Set to randomize from                               |
| __Tiles__               | The Tiles in the Tile Set.                                   |

## Usage

To create a **Tile Set**, first define the size of the Tile Set you want to paint by setting its size values in the **Tile Set Size** property. Then you can add Tile Sets manually with the Brush Editor or select them from an existing Tile Palette.

To select Tile Sets from an existing [Tile Palette](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Tilemap-Palette.html), enable the __Pick Random Tiles__ property and select the Tile Sets using the [Picker Tool](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Tilemap-Painting.html#Picker). This will create a Tile Set, or multiple Sets if the picked size is larger than the size set in the **Tile Set Size** property. Enable the __Add To Random Tiles__ property to add a picked selection of Tiles onto new or existing Tile Sets instead of replacing them.

When painting with the Random Brush, the Random Brush will randomly pick from the available Tile Sets while painting the Tiles.

## Implementation

The Random Brush inherits from the Grid Brush and implements the following overrides:

- It overrides the Paint method to paint random selections of Tiles from chosen Tile Sets. 
- It overrides the Pick method to be able to pick selections of Tiles for the random Tile Sets.
