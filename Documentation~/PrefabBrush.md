This Brush instances and places randomly selected Prefabs onto the target location and parents the instanced object to the [paint target](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Tilemap-Painting.htm). Use this Brush as an example to create custom Brushes which can quickly place an assortment of GameObjects onto structured locations.

## Usage

First set the number of Prefabs to select from in the __Prefabs__ property, then add Prefab Assets to the list. Adjust the __Perlin Scale__ property to adjust the distribution of Prefabs painted onto a particular cell.

When painting with the Prefab Brush, the Prefab Brush picks from the available Prefabs based on the __Perlin Scale__ set, and instantiate the Prefabs to the Scene.

## Implementation

The Prefab Brush inherits from the Grid Brush and implements the following overrides:

- It overrides the `Paint` method to paint a Prefab from the Prefab selection. 
- It overrides the `Erase` method to be able to erase the instantiated Prefabs or other GameObjects from the Scene.
