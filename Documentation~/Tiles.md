# Scriptable Tiles

You can script Tiles to adapt to different criteria and conditions, such as its position on the Tilemap. It then displays the Sprite which meets its scripted requirements.

The following are some implementations and examples of __Scriptables Tiles__ which can help save time when designing a [Tilemap](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Tilemap.html):


- [Animated Tile](AnimatedTile.md)
- [Pipeline Tile](PipelineTile.md)
- [Random Tile](RandomTile.md)
- [Rule Tile](RuleTile.md)
- [Rule Override Tile](RuleOverrideTile.md)
- [Terrain Tile](TerrainTile.md)
- [Weighted Random Tile](WeightedRandomTile.md)

Refer to the [Scriptable Tiles](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Tilemap-ScriptableTiles.html) documentation page for more information on creating your own Scriptable Tiles.
