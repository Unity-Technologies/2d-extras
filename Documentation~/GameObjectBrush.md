# GameObject Brush ![GameObject Brush Icon](images/GameObjectBrushIcon.png)

This Brush instances, places and manipulates GameObjects onto the Scene. Use this Brush as an example for creating custom Brushes which can target and manipulate other GameObjects beside Tiles.

## Usage

First select the GameObject Brush from the Brush drop-down menu. With the Brush selected, then select the [Picker Tool](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Tilemap-Painting.html#Picker) from the [Tile Palette](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Tilemap-Painting.html) toolbar. Use the [Select Tool](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Tilemap-Painting.html#Select) to select GameObjects from the Scene that you want the GameObject Brush to paint with. Note that these GameObjects must be a child of the active Grid to be selectable with this Brush.

When painting with the GameObject Brush, the Brush will instantiate GameObjects picked onto the Scene.

## Implementation

The GameObjectBrush inherits from the GridBrush and overrides several methods when implemented. The following methods are overridden:

- It overrides the `Paint` method to paint a GameObject. 
- It overrides the `Erase` method to erase the GameObjects from the Scene. 
- It overrides the `BoxFill` method to paint a GameObject in each cell defined by the [Box Tool](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Tilemap-Painting.html#Rec). 
- It overrides the `Move` methods to move GameObjects in the Scene. 
- It overrides the `Flip` methods to flip GameObjects in the picked selection.
